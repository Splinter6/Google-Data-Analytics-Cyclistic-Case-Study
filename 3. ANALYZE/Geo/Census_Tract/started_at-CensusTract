To assign each ride in your bikeshare dataset to the Census Tract they started in, you'll need two pieces of information:

Bikeshare Ride Data: This includes the start_lat and start_lng columns (representing the latitude and longitude where the ride started).
Census Tract Boundaries: This would typically be in the form of a GeoJSON or Shapefile that contains the boundaries of each Census Tract along with its unique identifier (e.g., census_tract_id).
Steps:
Load Census Tract Boundaries: This dataset needs to have polygon geometry for each Census Tract, along with the corresponding identifier.
Spatial Join: Use a spatial join to check which Census Tract polygon each ride's start_lat and start_lng coordinates fall within.
Example Query in BigQuery:
BigQuery supports geospatial functions, so you can perform a spatial join directly.


WITH census_tracts AS (
  SELECT
    census_tract_id,
    ST_GEOGFROMGEOJSON(geojson_column) AS tract_geom  -- Replace with actual geometry column from your Census Tract GeoJSON dataset
  FROM
    `your_project.your_dataset.census_tracts`
)

SELECT
  t1.ride_id,
  t1.start_lat,
  t1.start_lng,
  c.census_tract_id
FROM
  `cyclistic-data-strategy.555.ALLCLEAN` AS t1
JOIN
  census_tracts AS c
ON
  ST_WITHIN(ST_GEOGPOINT(t1.start_lng, t1.start_lat), c.tract_geom);  -- Spatial join to find the ride in the Census Tract


Census Tracts (census_tracts):

This CTE loads the Census Tract boundaries. It converts the GeoJSON column (geojson_column) containing the geometry into a GEOGRAPHY object using ST_GEOGFROMGEOJSON().
Bikeshare Rides (ALLCLEAN):

-The query reads the start_lat and start_lng from the bikeshare dataset and uses ST_GEOGPOINT() to create a geographic point from these coordinates.
Spatial Join:
-ST_WITHIN(): This function checks if the point (the ride's start location) falls within the boundaries of a Census Tract. If the ride is within a Census Tract, the census_tract_id is assigned to the ride.

Prerequisites:
-The Census Tract boundaries dataset should already exist in your BigQuery project, and the geometry should be in GeoJSON, WKT, or another geographic format.
-Ensure that your bikeshare data contains valid latitude and longitude values.

Output:
This query will assign each ride to a census_tract_id, allowing you to analyze rides based on the Census Tract where they started.
